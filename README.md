In this capstone, I took the role of a data scientist working for a new rocket company, Space Y. My job was to determine the price of each launch. I did this by gathering information about SpaceX and creating dashboards for our team. I also determined if SpaceX would be able to reuse the first stage of their rockets. 

Instead of using rocket science to determine if the first stage will land successfully, we trained a machine learning model and used public information to make predictions about their successful launches.
